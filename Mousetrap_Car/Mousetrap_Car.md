[Back to main page](https://skweston123.github.io/Portfolio/) 
- Project for a freshman year engineering course 
- Had to be fabricated and assembled by another student with no assistance from me
- Used a combination of off the shelf components, 3d printed parts, and parts made using simple hand tools
