Hi, I recently graduated from Montana State University with a BS in mechanical engineering and a minor in mechatronics. I'm very passionate about robotics and automation, and enjoy working at the intersection of mechanical, electrical and software engineering. I'm looking for work in my field, ideally involving robotics or mechatronics. While at Montana State, I worked on a number of interesting projects you can see listed below. Click on the headings to view the project pages for each.

- ### [Capstone Project](Rocket_Simulation/Rocket_Simulation.md)
  - Optical alignment station control system
  - UV LED epoxy curing station
- ### [Undergraduate Research](Rocket_Simulation/Rocket_Simulation.md)
  - Insect flapping frequency during warmup period before flight
  - Mathematical model of insect thorax to investigate interaction between the thorax and a flexible wing
- ### [Class Projects](Rocket_Simulation/Rocket_Simulation.md)
  - Inverted pendulum
  - RC car
  - Drill press vise
